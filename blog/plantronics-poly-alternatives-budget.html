      <h1>Plantronics and Poly Alternatives on a Budget</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9375rem;">Plantronics (now Poly by HP) is a long-standing leader in professional headsets. Here we look at budget alternatives that can meet similar needs.</p>

      <div class="card mt-2" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h3>Summary</h3>

      <h2>About Plantronics and Poly</h2>
      <p>Plantronics has been a pioneer in professional headsets since 1961. Now under the Poly by HP brand, they offer wireless and wired models including the Savi and Voyager series. They are recognised for comfort, durability and advanced noise cancellation and have deep enterprise presence in call centres and offices. If you want similar functionality without the premium price, budget alternatives are worth considering.</p>

      <h2>What to look for in an alternative</h2>
      <p>Match your use case: wireless vs wired, over-ear vs on-ear, and compatibility with your phone system or computer. Check microphone quality, battery life (for wireless), and comfort for long wear. We highlight Mairdi headsets as value options—view the full range through our partner. We service Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart and offer bulk orders and bulk discounts. For other hardware (switches, routers, phone systems, handsets), our partner Telco Broker can assist via our <a href="../contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
