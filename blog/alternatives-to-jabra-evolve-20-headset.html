        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0;">The Jabra Evolve 20 is a popular wired USB headset for offices. Budget alternatives typically offer plug-and-play USB, noise-reducing microphones and comfortable wear at a lower cost. Consider Mairdi and other value brands when buying in volume.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is the Jabra Evolve 20?</h2>
      <p>The Jabra Evolve 20 is a wired, over-the-head USB headset aimed at office and call centre use. It is known for clear audio, a noise-cancelling microphone and reliable compatibility with computers and softphones. Jabra holds significant market share in professional audio and is considered a global leader in business headsets. The Evolve 20 sits in a price range that can be high when equipping many seats.</p>

      <h2>Why look for alternatives?</h2>
      <p>Many businesses need dependable voice quality and comfort without the premium brand price. Call centres and small offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart often look for budget headset options that still meet typical requirements: clear voice pickup, comfortable fit for long shifts and simple USB connectivity. Value alternatives can reduce cost per seat and make it easier to scale or replace units.</p>

      <h2>What to look for in an alternative</h2>
      <p>When evaluating alternatives to the Jabra Evolve 20, consider the following. <strong>Connection:</strong> USB plug-and-play is standard for desk use. <strong>Microphone:</strong> Noise-reducing or noise-cancelling mics improve clarity in busy environments. <strong>Comfort:</strong> Padded headband and earpads matter for all-day use. <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Most USB headsets work with standard audio interfaces and major softphone applications. <strong>Warranty and support:</strong> Check typical warranty periods and replacement availability if you are buying in bulk.</p>
