      <h1>Best Budget Bluetooth Headsets in Australia</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9375rem;">A practical guide to choosing value Bluetooth headsets for business and home use in Australia.</p>

      <div class="card mt-2" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Budget Bluetooth headsets can deliver clear voice and reliable connectivity for calls and collaboration. Look for battery life, comfort, microphone quality and multipoint support. Mairdi and other value brands offer options at a lower cost than Jabra, Plantronics and EPOS.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Bluetooth for business?</h2>
      <p>Bluetooth headsets free you from cables and work with computers, smartphones and tablets. They suit hybrid workers, mobile professionals and anyone who moves during calls. Premium brands such as Jabra and Plantronics (Poly) are known for advanced noise reduction and strong connectivity; EPOS and Logitech also offer well-regarded business models. For many users, budget Bluetooth headsets provide sufficient quality at a fraction of the cost.</p>

      <h2>What to consider when buying</h2>
      <p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Typical ranges are several hours to a full day of use; check manufacturer specs. <strong>Comfort:</strong> Over-ear and on-ear styles; choose according to how long you wear the headset. <strong>Microphone:</strong> Noise cancellation or noise reduction improves clarity in busy environments. <strong>Multipoint:</strong> Allows connection to two devices (e.g. phone and PC) and switching between them. <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Most Bluetooth headsets work with standard Bluetooth profiles; verify support for your devices.</p>
