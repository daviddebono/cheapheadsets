      <h1>Noise Cancellation in Headsets Explained</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9375rem;">Understanding passive and active noise cancellation, and microphone noise reduction, in business headsets.</p>

      <div class="card mt-2" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Headsets can reduce noise in two ways: passive (earcup seal and design) and active (electronics that cancel ambient sound). Microphone noise cancellation reduces what the other party hears. Budget headsets often offer good passive isolation and noise-reducing mics.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Passive noise cancellation</h2>
      <p>Passive noise reduction comes from the physical design: over-ear earcups that seal around the ear, or on-ear pads that block some sound. No electronics are involved. Many budget headsets rely on passive isolation and can achieve typical reductions sufficient for office and home use.</p>

      <h2>Active noise cancellation (ANC)</h2>
      <p>Active noise cancellation uses microphones and electronics to pick up ambient noise and produce an opposing sound to cancel it. It is more common in premium headsets and can improve focus in very noisy environments. ANC adds cost; for many call centre and office scenarios, passive isolation plus a good microphone is enough.</p>

      <h2>Microphone noise cancellation</h2>
      <p>What matters most for the other party is how clear your voice is. Microphone noise cancellation (or noise reduction) filters out background noise from your voice before it is sent. Many budget headsets include noise-reducing mics that work well for typical office and home backgrounds. When comparing <a href="../products/bluetooth-headsets.html">Bluetooth</a>, <a href="../products/usb-headsets.html">USB</a> or <a href="../products/telephone-headsets.html">telephone</a> headsets, check whether the product specifies noise reduction or noise cancellation on the microphone.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need active noise cancellation for calls?</h3>
          <p>Not necessarily. Passive isolation and a noise-reducing microphone are often sufficient. ANC can help in very loud environments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do budget headsets have noise cancellation?</h3>
          <p>Many budget models offer passive isolation and microphone noise reduction. Full ANC is more common on higher-priced models.</p>
