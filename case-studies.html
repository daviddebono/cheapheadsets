      <h1>Case Studies</h1>
      <p><strong>These scenarios are illustrative only.</strong> They show typical ways businesses use budget headsets. Outcomes depend on your environment and choices.</p>

      <h2>Small call centre, Melbourne</h2>
      <p>A small outbound team in Melbourne (inner suburbs) needed to replace ageing wired headsets. They wanted lower cost per seat and simple USB connectivity. They evaluated premium USB headsets against value options, chose a budget USB headset range, and ordered in bulk. The result was lower upfront cost and easier replacement when units failed, without sacrificing acceptable call quality for their use case.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid office, Sydney</h2>
      <p>An Sydney-based company with staff in the CBD and Parramatta moved to a hybrid model. They needed wireless and Bluetooth headsets for desk and mobile use. Rather than equipping everyone with top-tier brands, they trialled budget wireless and Bluetooth options. Staff reported satisfactory comfort and audio for video calls and softphone use. The business saved on hardware spend and used the savings for other IT priorities.</p>

      <h2>Remote team, Brisbane and Adelaide</h2>
      <p>A distributed team with members in Brisbane (including suburbs such as Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane) and Adelaide (including North Adelaide, Glenelg) needed consistent audio for daily stand-ups and client calls. They standardised on a single budget USB and Bluetooth headset range. Bulk ordering and discounts reduced per-unit cost, and having one SKU simplified support and ordering.</p>

      <h2>Desk-phone environment, Canberra</h2>
      <p>An organisation in Canberra using traditional desk phones wanted to move to telephone headsets for hands-free use. They compared premium telephone headset brands with budget alternatives. They selected a value telephone headset model and rolled it out across the office. Call clarity and comfort were sufficient for their volume, and the lower price allowed them to equip more staff within budget.</p>
