      <p>USB headsets plug directly into your computer and are ideal for call centres, contact centres and desk-based workers. They offer plug-and-play setup, consistent audio and no need for Bluetooth pairing. This page explains the benefits of USB headsets and how budget options such as Mairdi compare to mainstream brands.</p>

      <h2>Why USB headsets?</h2>
      <p>USB headsets connect via a single cable to your PC or Mac. They are typically recognised automatically by the operating system and work with major softphone and collaboration applications. There is no battery to charge at your desk, and audio quality is usually stable. For high-volume environments such as call centres, USB headsets are a common choice. Premium brands like Jabra, Plantronics (Poly), EPOS and Logitech offer USB models with advanced noise cancellation and comfort features. Budget USB headsets can deliver reliable voice and listening quality at a fraction of the cost, which is especially useful when equipping many seats.</p>

      <h2>Mainstream brands vs value options</h2>
      <p>Jabra and Plantronics (Poly) are leaders in professional USB headsets, with strong adoption in enterprises. EPOS (formerly Sennheiser Communications) is known for superior sound and technologies such as BrainAdapt™. Logitech has gained ground with models like the Zone 950 and strong integration with video tools. For businesses that prioritise cost without sacrificing acceptable quality, Mairdi and similar value brands offer USB headsets that meet typical call centre and office requirements. We provide product information and links to view and purchase Mairdi USB headsets through our partner.</p>

      <h2>What to consider</h2>
      <p>Look for a comfortable fit for long wearing, a noise-cancelling or noise-reducing microphone, and compatibility with your software (most USB headsets work with standard audio interfaces). Mono (one ear) vs stereo (both ears) depends on whether agents need to hear ambient sound. In-line controls for volume and mute are convenient. For bulk purchases, consistency across units and availability of replacement parts can simplify support.</p>
