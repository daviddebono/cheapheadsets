      <p>Telephone headsets connect to your desk phone or phone system, giving you hands-free operation and clear two-way audio. They are a staple in reception, support and office environments that still use traditional handsets. Here we outline what to look for in a budget telephone headset and how Mairdi and other value options compare to premium brands.</p>

      <h2>Why use a telephone headset?</h2>
      <p>Telephone headsets free your hands for typing and note-taking while on a call. They improve comfort during long conversations and can reduce neck and shoulder strain compared with cradling a handset. Compatibility with your phone system is key: most modern telephone headsets use a standard connector (e.g. 2.5 mm or RJ9) or an adaptor that fits your phone model. Premium brands such as Plantronics (Poly), Jabra and EPOS have long been used in call centres and offices; Leitner is another option with features like UniBase® for merging desk phone, computer and mobile. Budget telephone headsets from Mairdi and similar suppliers can provide reliable voice quality and comfort at a lower cost.</p>

      <h2>Mainstream brands and value alternatives</h2>
      <p>Plantronics (Poly) is a pioneer in professional telephone headsets, with models in the Savi and Voyager families. Jabra offers strong noise reduction and connectivity. EPOS brings high-quality audio from Sennheiser heritage. For many businesses, a value telephone headset is sufficient—clear voice pickup, comfortable wear and compatibility with the desk phone. We highlight Mairdi telephone headset options with details and links to view and purchase through our partner Telco Broker.</p>

      <h2>Choosing a telephone headset</h2>
      <p>Check compatibility with your phone (make and model). Decide between over-the-head, behind-the-neck or over-the-ear styles. Mono (one earpiece) is common for reception and support; dual earpieces can help in noisier environments. Consider cord length if you move around your desk, and whether you need a quick-disconnect for sharing. For bulk deployment, standardising on one or two models simplifies ordering and support.</p>
